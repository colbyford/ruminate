Description: Exploration of pharmacometrics data data involves  both general tools (transformation and plotting) and  specific techniques (non-compartmental analysis). This kind of exploration  is generally accomplished by utilizing different packages. The purpose of 'ruminate' is to create a Shiny interface to make these tools more broadly available while creating reproducible results.
